/*
 * EclipseR.cpp
 *
 * This Program reads data from an eclipse data file and creates
 * Eclipse Objects. It also checks for errors in the eclipse input.
 * The program stores all eclipse objects in a doubly linked list.
 * The program in turn, after getting data, manipulates the data
 * by sorting or searching through it. Searching and sorting is
 * only attempted by converting the eclipses list into a resizable array.
