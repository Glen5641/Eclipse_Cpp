/*
 * EclipseR.h

 * This Program reads data from an eclipse data file and creates
 * Eclipse Objects. It also checks for errors in the eclipse input.
 * The program stores all eclipse objects in a doubly linked list,
 * resizable array, and a hashmap. The program in turn, after getting
 * data, manipulates the data by sorting or searching, merging or
 * purging, and outputing. Searching and sorting is only attempted
 * by converting the eclipses list into a resizable array.
